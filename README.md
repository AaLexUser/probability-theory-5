### Probability theory 5

This project was inspired by the practical work assignment in a statistics course.

### Overview

This project is an implementation of a program to analyze a given dataset of 20 numbers. The program calculates various statistical characteristics, such as the variation series, extreme values, range, expected value, standard deviation, empirical distribution function, and grouped frequency distribution. The results of the analysis, along with the program listing, are presented in a LaTeX report.

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- LaTeX distribution (e.g., TeX Live, MiKTeX, or MacTeX)
  Usage

1. Clone the repository:
   `git clone https://github.com/username/project.git`
2. Run the Python program:
   `python main.py`
3. Compile the LaTeX report:
   `pdflatex main.tex`
4. Open the generated main.pdf to view the results.

### Structure

- main.py: The main Python script containing the implementation of the statistical analysis.
- main.tex: The LaTeX source file for the report, which includes the program listing and the results of the analysis.
